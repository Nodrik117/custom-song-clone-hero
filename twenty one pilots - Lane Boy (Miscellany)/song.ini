loading_phrase = Tyler Joseph (twenty one pilots' singer) about "Lane Boy": "I describe "Lane Boy" as the moment where I broke character. Saying things that weren’t necessarily artistic or beautiful, but exactly what I wanted to say and exactly what I was feeling. I broke character and became a frustrated human. For a moment. I don’t imagine needing to say things like that anymore. I remember showing that song to some people and they said: "I don’t think you want to say that…". But Josh (twenty one pilots' drummer) said to me: "Let’s say it."".<br>Huge thanks to Ahdree for commissioning this chart!
