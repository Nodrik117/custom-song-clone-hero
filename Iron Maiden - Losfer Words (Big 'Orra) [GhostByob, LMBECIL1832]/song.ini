loading_phrase = This is the fourth and last instrumental recorded by Iron Maiden. The guitar harmonies and galloping bass are almost a perfect distillation of the sound of the album. The title is a bit of wordplay. It is a transliteration of how someone with a thick cockney accent would say “Loss for Words (Big Horror).” The fact that the track is instrumental justifies the “Loss for Words” title.
